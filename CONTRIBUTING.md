# Contributor Manual for Schematics Documentation

Welcome to our project! We're thrilled to have you here and appreciate contributions of any size and skill level. This project uniquely bridges Schematics with the wider JavaScript ecosystem, and we're excited to see the innovative ways you'll help us expand its capabilities.

## How to Get Started

First, familiarize yourself with our project's existing documentation at [Schematics Documentation](https://schematics.pbuilder.dev/). Understanding what's already covered will help you identify areas for improvement or new topics that could benefit our users.

## Types of Documentation Contributions

We value a wide range of contributions, from code to documentation, from new schematics to improving existing ones for better compatibility with non-Angular environments. Here are some ways you can contribute:

- **Tutorial Contributions**: Have you developed a unique solution or implemented an interesting use case with Schematics? We'd love to see your walkthroughs, step-by-step guides, or comprehensive tutorials.

- **Error Corrections**: If you notice inaccuracies, typos, or outdated information in our documentation, please let us know. Your keen eye can help ensure our documentation remains accurate and useful.

- **Adding New Information**: Technology evolves rapidly, and so do best practices. Contributions that add new insights, tips, or best practices are always welcome.

## Submitting Your Contribution
