Welcome to this section 🎉. You know my goal is to make schematics for humans 👩‍💻👨‍💻. For this reason, I've not only created this documentation but will also share all the new and exciting stuff that's coming soon 🚀.

<br/>

<Card title="Schematics bank"  icon="pencil">
   This documentation enables every JavaScript developer to create their own schematics 📝. But you might wonder:<br/>
<strong>"If I create my own schematics, where can I share them?"</strong> or <strong>"Where can I find schematics from the community?"</strong>
Currently, there’s no direct solution 🤔. However, I’m developing a website where everyone can publish and share information about their schematics 🌐.

<Card title="Advance tutorials"  icon="pencil">
    Embarking on the schematics journey requires learning from the most basic concepts to the most advanced 📚. I aim to guide you through maximizing the potential of schematics, ensuring you get the most out of them 💪.

Remember, your contributions help continue this amazing project and assist in creating <strong>Schematics for Humans</strong> ❤️.
