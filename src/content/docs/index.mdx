## Key Scenarios for Using Schematics
<CardGrid stagger>
    <Card title="Repetitive Tasks" icon="pencil">
        When you're building similar features or components repeatedly, schematics can automate the process. Instead of manually duplicating code or recreating the same patterns, you can create a schematic that generates this code for you. This saves time and ensures consistency across your project.
    </Card>
    <Card title="Workshops or Training" icon="magnifier">
        Schematics are perfect for teaching JavaScript or guiding participants through workshops. You can break down each part of your workshop into different schematics, allowing participants to incrementally build their project while learning. They can apply updates seamlessly, ensuring everyone is on the same page with the latest changes.
    </Card>
    <Card title="Boilerplate Code" icon="rocket">
       When starting a new project or module, you often need to establish a common structure or baseline code. Schematics can generate this boilerplate code for you, ensuring that every new project starts with a consistent, predefined structure, minimizing setup time and avoiding repetitive coding.
    </Card>
    <Card title="Onboarding New Team Members" icon="setting">
        When new developers join your team, schematics can ease their onboarding by generating templates for the most common tasks or features they will work on. This reduces the learning curve, guiding them with pre-configured best practices and minimizing errors as they get up to speed.
