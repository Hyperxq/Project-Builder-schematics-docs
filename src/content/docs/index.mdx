## Features
<CardGrid stagger>
    <Card title="Code Completion" icon="pencil">
        As you write code, Refact suggests potential code completions based on the context of your code,
    looking up and down. It can suggest whole functions, classes, commonly used programming patterns,
    libraries, and APIs usage.
    </Card>
    <Card title="Improve code" icon="magnifier">
        Refact can identify code that could be refactored to be more efficient or easier to understand.
    It can also detect bugs in your code and generate patches to fix them.
    </Card>
    <Card title="AI Chat" icon="rocket">
        Use plain language prompts in Refact chat to ask questions or get help with
    writing code without leaving your IDE.
    </Card>
    <Card title="Transform and analyze code" icon="setting">
        Refact can analyze the complexity of your code and explain unclear lines of code.
