## Introduction

When you want to start creating schematics, you likely have two questions:

## How can I create schematics?

To create schematics, you need to create an npm project library.

**Requirements:**

```ansi title="Schematics CLI"
[38;2;127;86;217mnpm i -g[0m [38;2;0;134;201m@angular-devkit/schematics-cli[0m
```

```ansi title="Project Builder CLI"
npm i -g [38;2;127;86;217m@pbuilder/cli[0m 
```

**Execute:**

```ansi title="Creation of schematic library project"
[38;2;127;86;217mnpx @pbuilder/cli[0m [38;2;0;134;201mnew[0m [38;2;23;178;106m<project-name> [author][0m --bundler <bundler-name> --package-manager <manager> --dry-run --help
```

When you create schematic projects with Project Builder, you already have all the settings to publish. Feel free to add your schematics and publish them ðŸ˜„.

## How can I execute schematics?

Once you have published your schematics, you might want to use them.

There are two options or scenarios:

1. If you want to run the schematics only once and are not interested in installing them permanently, you can execute:

```ansi title="CLI installed"
[38;2;127;86;217mbuilder[0m [38;2;0;134;201mexecute[0m [38;2;23;178;106m<collection-name> <schematic-name>[0m [38;2;133;136;142mâ€”[all options separated by two dashes][0m
```

1. If you would like to keep the schematics installed, you can execute:

```ansi title="CLI installed"

[38;2;127;86;217mbuilder[0m [38;2;0;134;201madd[0m [38;2;23;178;106m<collection-name>[0m [38;2;133;136;142mâ€”[all options separated by two dashes][0m

```
