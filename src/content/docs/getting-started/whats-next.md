Congratulations! ðŸš€ You now have a functional project. But since you're using schematics to automate code, you might be wondering, "What comes next?"

When you want to automate code, you will need to:

* [Gather User Inputs](/terminal/user-inputs).
* [Manipulate Files](/files/how-to-start).
* [Install Dependencies](/install-dependencies).
* Run scripts (*pending*).

In the following sections, we'll delve into each of these areas to help you make the most out of your schematics and enhance your project automation. Stay tuned!
